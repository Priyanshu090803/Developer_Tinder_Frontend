# Deployment Issues and Solutions

## Main Issues Identified

### 1. **CORS Configuration Missing**
**Problem**: Your frontend was making requests with `withCredentials: true` to the production backend without proper CORS configuration.

**Solution**: 
- Added CORS configuration in `vite.config.js`
- Added proxy configuration for development
- Updated socket connection with proper CORS settings

### 2. **Hardcoded Production URLs**
**Problem**: All API calls were hardcoded to use `BASE_URL_PRODUCTION` even in development.

**Solution**:
- Created environment-based URL configuration
- Added `API_BASE_URL` that automatically switches based on environment
- Created `.env` file support for configuration

### 3. **Socket.IO Connection Issues**
**Problem**: Socket connection was using hardcoded production URL without proper error handling.

**Solution**:
- Updated socket connection to use environment-aware URL
- Added proper error handling and connection events
- Added timeout and transport configuration

### 4. **Missing Error Handling**
**Problem**: API calls lacked proper error handling for production scenarios.

**Solution**:
- Created centralized API utility with interceptors
- Added automatic token handling
- Added automatic redirect on authentication errors

## Environment Configuration

### Create `.env` file in your project root:
```env
# Production
VITE_API_URL=https://hooman.onrender.com

# Development (uncomment for local development)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### For different environments:
- **Development**: Use `http://localhost:3000`
- **Production**: Use `https://hooman.onrender.com`
- **Staging**: Use your staging backend URL

## Backend Requirements

Make sure your backend has proper CORS configuration:

```javascript
// Backend CORS configuration
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['http://localhost:5173', 'https://your-frontend-domain.com'],
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'PATCH'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization']
}))
```

## Testing the Connection

1. **Check Network Tab**: Open browser dev tools and check for CORS errors
2. **Check Console**: Look for socket connection errors
3. **Test API Endpoints**: Try a simple GET request to verify connectivity

## Common Production Issues

1. **HTTPS/HTTP Mismatch**: Ensure both frontend and backend use HTTPS in production
2. **Domain Mismatch**: Make sure CORS origin includes your frontend domain
3. **Cookie Issues**: Ensure cookies are set with proper domain and secure flags
4. **Socket.IO Transport**: Some hosting providers block WebSocket connections
